              We may be collecting and using information from you if you are
              from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our
              Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this
              data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection
              from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
            </span>
            <h1 class="privacy-text110">What is GDPR?</h1>
            <span>
              <span>
                GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that
                regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and
                enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal
                data.
              </span>
              <br />

              <span></span>
              <br />
              <span>
                The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not
                just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’
                data is important irrespective of where they are located, which
                is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline
                standard for all our operations worldwide.

              <span></span>
              <span>
                Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified
                individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
                could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of
                information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond
                a person’s
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>

            <h1 class="privacy-text139">Why is GDPR important?</h1>
            <span>
              GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should
              protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process.
              It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement
              and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's
              simply the right thing to do. At VPN "Ы" we strongly believe that
              your data privacy is very important and we already have solid
              security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the
              requirements of this new regulation.
