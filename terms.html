            jury. The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration in
            accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American
            Arbitration Association. Either party may seek any interim or
            preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent
            jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property
            pending the completion of arbitration. Any and all legal,
